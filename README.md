# Live News Platform - Trending Topics Explorer

Interactive Keyword-Based News Retrieval: Enhancing Content Discovery with NLP and Real-Time Data Processing

A dynamic word cloud visualization platform that transforms trending news topics into interactive visual experiences. Built with advanced NLP techniques and real-time data processing, this system provides users with an intuitive way to explore evolving news landscapes.

## Overview

This research project, developed in association with Saint Peter's University, addresses the growing need for accessible news exploration tools. By combining Google Trends data with news headlines, our system enhances the contextual relevance of trending keywords and provides real-time insights into current events.

The platform features interactive visualizations powered by D3.js, smart content discovery with related news articles and videos, a real-time Python data pipeline, modern responsive UI with theme support, and trend analysis through PyTrends integration.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- Web Server: Node.js/Express serving static HTML
- Visualization Engine: D3.js for interactive word clouds
- Client-side Logic: Vanilla JavaScript for user interactions
- Data Format: JSON files generated by the Python pipeline

### Backend Pipeline
- Data Sources: NYTimes Top Stories API, Microsoft Bing News and Video Search APIs
- NLP Processing: NLTK for text analysis
- Trend Scoring: Hybrid algorithm combining word frequency (40%) with PyTrends data (60%)
- Visualization Generation: WordCloud library for visual processing

## Quick Start

### Demo Mode
For exploring the interface with sample data:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajayrajsingh2003/live-news-platform.git
cd live-news-platform
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to explore the platform with pre-loaded sample data.

### Full Pipeline Setup

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests nltk wordcloud matplotlib pytrends python-dotenv
```

Configure API keys by creating `config/.env`:
```env
NYT_API_KEY=your_nytimes_api_key_here
AZURE_API_KEY=your_bing_search_api_key_here
```

Required API keys:
- NYTimes API: Register at developer.nytimes.com
- Microsoft Bing Search API: Available through Azure Cognitive Services

Generate fresh data:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

Launch the platform:
```bash
npm start
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

The system employs a multi-stage data processing workflow:

**Stage 1: Data Acquisition**
- Headlines Collection: Fetches top US news from NYTimes API
- Content Enrichment: Retrieves related articles and videos from Bing

**Stage 2: NLP Processing**
- Text Analysis: Keyword extraction and cleaning
- Trend Scoring: Advanced scoring algorithm combining word frequency analysis (40% weight) with Google Trends real-time data (60% weight)
- Visualization Preparation: Word cloud generation and JSON formatting

**Stage 3: Content Integration**
- Data Orchestration: Combines all data sources
- Output Generation: Creates optimized JSON files for frontend consumption

Generated data files include `wordcloud.json` for word frequencies and trending scores, and `headlines.json` for structured news articles and video content.

## Usage

The interface provides several interaction methods:

1. Word Cloud View: Interactive visualization loads automatically
2. Topic Selection: Click any word to discover related content
3. Content Browser: Switch between news articles and video tabs
4. Pagination: Load more results for comprehensive coverage
5. Layout Toggle: Switch between cloud and structured grid views
6. Theme Control: Toggle between dark and light modes

Advanced features include color-coded categories for visual distinction, responsive design optimized for all devices, lazy loading for efficient performance, and real-time updates through pipeline execution.

## Deployment

The platform is ready for Heroku deployment:
```bash
git push heroku main
```

The architecture supports flexible deployment with frontend independence, modular pipeline design, and scalable integration options for additional news sources.
