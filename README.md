# Live News Platform - Trending Topics Explorer

## Interactive Keyword-Based News Retrieval: Enhancing Content Discovery with NLP and Real-Time Data Processing
**Saint Peter's Research** â†’[Saint Peter's Instant Newsroom for Student](https://word-cloud-peacock-eea067d6545e.herokuapp.com/)

A dynamic word cloud visualization platform that transforms trending news topics into interactive visual experiences. Built with advanced NLP techniques and real-time data processing, this system provides users with an intuitive way to explore evolving news landscapes.

## Overview

This research project, developed in association with Saint Peter's University, addresses the growing need for accessible news exploration tools. By combining Google Trends data with news headlines, our system enhances the contextual relevance of trending keywords and provides real-time insights into current events.

Unlike static word clouds, our system dynamically processes real-time news data using Natural Language Processing (NLP), web scraping, and API integration. It extracts and visualizes frequently occurring keywords, allowing users to interact with them. Upon selection, the system triggers a query-based retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant multimedia content, including articles and videos, in real time. This interactive approach bridges the gap between static visualization and dynamic content retrieval, enabling users to explore evolving news trends efficiently.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- Web Server: Node.js/Express serving static HTML
- Visualization Engine: D3.js for interactive word clouds
- Client-side Logic: Vanilla JavaScript for user interactions
- Data Format: JSON files generated by the Python pipeline

### Backend Pipeline
- Data Sources: NYTimes Top Stories API, Microsoft Bing News and Video Search APIs
- NLP Processing: NLTK for text analysis
- Trend Scoring: Hybrid algorithm combining word frequency (40%) with PyTrends data (60%)
- Visualization Generation: WordCloud library for visual processing

## Quick Start

### Demo Mode
For exploring the interface with sample data:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ajayrajsingh2003/live-news-platform.git
cd live-news-platform
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to explore the platform with pre-loaded sample data.

### Full Pipeline Setup

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install requests nltk wordcloud matplotlib pytrends python-dotenv
```

Configure API keys by creating `config/.env`:
```env
NYT_API_KEY=your_nytimes_api_key_here
AZURE_API_KEY=your_bing_search_api_key_here
```

Required API keys:
- NYTimes API: Register at developer.nytimes.com
- Microsoft Bing Search API: Available through Azure Cognitive Services

Generate fresh data:
```bash
python src/main.py
```

Launch the platform:
```bash
npm start
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

The system employs a multi-stage data processing workflow:

**Stage 1: Data Acquisition**
- Headlines Collection: Fetches top US news from NYTimes API
- Content Enrichment: Retrieves related articles and videos from Bing

**Stage 2: NLP Processing**
- Text Analysis: Keyword extraction and cleaning
- Trend Scoring: Advanced scoring algorithm combining word frequency analysis (40% weight) with Google Trends real-time data (60% weight)
- Visualization Preparation: Word cloud generation and JSON formatting

**Stage 3: Content Integration**
- Data Orchestration: Combines all data sources
- Output Generation: Creates optimized JSON files for frontend consumption

Generated data files include `wordcloud.json` for word frequencies and trending scores, and `headlines.json` for structured news articles and video content.
